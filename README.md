Welcome to the Java Multithreading Quiz! This README provides an overview of our interactive quiz application that focuses on multithreading concepts in Java. Our quiz is not just about answering questions â€“ it's a dynamic and engaging learning experience.

About the Quiz
Multithreading is a fundamental concept in Java programming that allows you to run multiple threads (smaller units of a process) concurrently. Our Java Multithreading Quiz aims to make learning about multithreading both informative and exciting. Here's what sets our quiz apart:

Interactive Learning: Instead of a traditional static quiz, we've designed our quiz as an interactive application that brings concepts to life. You'll not only answer questions but also see multithreading principles in action.

Multithreading Methods Showcase: Our quiz incorporates various multithreading methods, including stop, resume, and more. As you progress through the quiz, you'll encounter scenarios where these methods are applied, helping you grasp their practical usage.

Engaging Lifelines: We've added lifelines to the quiz to enhance your learning journey. Need a hint or a second chance? Use the lifelines strategically to deepen your understanding.
